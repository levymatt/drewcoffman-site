    "review": "The only thing I've ever read that accurately diagnoses the biggest current mismatch I care about: artists are being forced to optimize for algorithm games and personal branding when their actual skill is reading and synthesizing cultural signals. 'Content' is not what they're naturally good at, and it's soul-crushing. The hot take here is that trading infrastructure is actually MORE aligned with artist skillsets than the current content-marketing hellscape. As my dear friend Jose said, 'this is correct in ways that i genuinely think only about 20-30 people truly fully understand right now and i hope the 20-30 of us that get it end up stupidly fucking wealthy for being right.'"

    "review": "Robin Sloan's Amulets project remains one of my favorite things ever created in crypto, which makes it genuinely sad that he's moved on from experimenting in the space. This essay captures what made it special. Someone who was both curious and skeptical, building something that felt like genuine magic."
